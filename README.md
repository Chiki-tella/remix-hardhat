# SafeSave Blockchain Prototype

A Hardhat v3 + Remix blockchain project template demonstrating deployment and interaction of Solidity smart contracts using **ViEM**.  

This project serves as a foundation for building cooperative savings systems like **SafeSave**, where members can deposit funds and track balances on-chain, preventing fraud or mismanagement.

---

## Features

- Compile and deploy Solidity contracts locally using Hardhat v3
- Interact with contracts using TypeScript scripts
- Example contract `ReactangleArea.sol` with console debugging
- Ready for extension to cooperative/fund management systems
- Fully compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS environments

---

## Smart Contracts Included

### `ReactangleArea.sol`
- Simple contract demonstrating calculation logic
- Uses `console.log` for debugging
- Shows deployment and interaction workflow

### `SafeSave.sol`
- Tracks deposits of cooperative members
- Records individual balances and total savings
- Event logging for all deposits
